## Contribute with development

### How to contribute
Everyone can contribute to the development of DevMailCenter. To help the development, please first create an issue to discuss what you want to change and work on your changes in a seperate branch connected to this issue. Afterwards you can merge your branch to the main by a PR. 

### Start developing
To start developing you will need to do 2 things. 
- Create a copy of appsettings.json and name it appsettings.Development.json. This file can be used for your test data without risking the file with secrets being pushed to the open github.
- Run the dev-docker-compose.yml docker-compose file to create the external needed software stack required by this program to run in full. The needed software to run a locally dev docker environment needed to run this docker-compose file can be downloaded on https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
